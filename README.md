# sros_configs-services_to_excel
An attempt to parse Alcatel-Lucent 7750 Services in a configuration file to excel.

This is a project I decided to do help me practise my python and regex.

## Todo
* ~~Get services from configuration file~~ (Done but in a dirty way)
* Input in Excel using openpyxl
* Clean up code

Any comments or suggestions are welcome.
